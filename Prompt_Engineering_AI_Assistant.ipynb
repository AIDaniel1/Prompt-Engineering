        "   = 100 units/week × 2 weeks = 200 units\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Safety Stock Calculation:\n",
        "   For a 95% service level, we typically use 1.65 standard deviations.\n",
        "   If we assume demand variability (standard deviation) of 20 units/week:\n",

        "   Safety Stock = Z-score × σ_demand × √Lead Time\n",

        "3. Reorder Point Formula:\n",
        "   Reorder Point = Lead Time Demand + Safety Stock\n",
        "   = 200 units + 47 units = 247 units\n",
        "\n",

        "IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:\n",
        "- When inventory drops to 247 units, place new order\n",

        "- Monitor actual demand variability monthly and adjust safety stock\n",
